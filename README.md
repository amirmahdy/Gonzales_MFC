# Gonzales_MFC
Gonzales Image processing exercises in MFC


This program is written based on Gonzales Image processing book practices, and OpenCV library in C.
It also utilizes MFC as an interface. Most of the techniques and filters are written based on standard libs.
This will be a good example to demonstrate the output of excercises in class.
